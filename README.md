# Shnote

Shnote is a bash script I made because I needed a efficient way to take notes from the terminal.

It is a simple command line tool to take notes.


# Installation

you can use the install script from shnote folder.
./install

# Usage

Once shnote has been installed simply add a new note by typing

    shnote my note title

to get help type :

    shnote --help

to display all notes type :

    shnote --list

show how many notes have been saved

    shnote --count


# Todo

    - Complete this README.md
    - Add a function to create a backup of the notes
    - Add a way to delete some note or all of them
    - Add the possibility to export notes in CSV
    - Add a search function
    - Make it possible to ass tags via the command line (alone with the note title)
